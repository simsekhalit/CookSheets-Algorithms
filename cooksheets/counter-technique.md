## Counter Technique
Counter technique is simply using same old `dict` object in Python to solve the problems. There is also specific
subclass of `dict` for this matter as `collections.Counter`. The key point of this technique is not how to use
counters but rather how to develop an algorithm which uses counters to solve the problem efficiently. Therefore 
related problems are going to be much more explanatory for this topic.
